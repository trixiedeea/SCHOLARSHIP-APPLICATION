SCRIPT:
"Hello. My name is Traci Dirom, and today I want to share with you how I've spent the last roughly 10 years making technology accessible, affordable, and empowering for communities that have been traditionally underserved in the IT industry. This is the story of my impacts, innovations, and leadership in information technology. And it is about how the SJSU MLIS program will allow me to continue those impacts, innovations, and leadership.”

 🎬 SLIDES 2/3 — Who I Am

SCRIPT:
"I am one of less than a hundred women working in the IT industry in the city of Kelowna, British Columbia. I’m a woman in a male-dominated field who managed to build a successful company despite the prejudices and barriers. I am a person who built a career doing something I truly believed in: bringing technology to people in ways that are easy to understand, affordable to access, and designed to empower rather than intimidate.

I am a millennial, which gives me a unique position because of my age and experience. My generation has interacted with computer technology from the very beginning. I remember DOS-only platforms where everything was command-line controlled and the mouse didn't exist. I remember before there was Google, internet and social media. Never again will a generation interact with the bell curve of computer technology from the beginning to where it is now in the way mine has. We were removed enough that we can function perfectly well without it but not so old we couldn’t really understand it. Computer technology grew up alongside us and I think it’s been easier for us to understand because of that. We know the foundation because we watched as it was built. 

I am a multi-linguist fluent in French, English, JavaScript and python and an avid learner who has taught myself basic electronic circuitry, wiring and repair, software troubleshooting and repair; learned to love the command line, and have accumulated enough tricks and little backdoors— that I'm actually putting them together in a manual right now.

 🎬 SLIDES 5/6 — My Proudest Project: The Board Game
SCRIPT:
“The project I'm most proud of is a simple board game I created, coded, and developed for a class project. It is a fully interactive digital board game built entirely with JavaScript and HTML, hosted on github and completely browser based with no downloads. I handled everything from start to finish: —ideation, prototyping, coding, debugging, interface design, and user testing. I completed the class with a grade of 97% overall.  

The game is playable with either human players or computer players. The only limitation is that it doesn't support multiple entry points, so all human players have to play from the same screen. I'm incredibly proud of it because of the depth and versatility I was able to achieve. I didn't realize I was capable of creating something with that much complexity.

Due to course deadlines, I was forced to hand in a skeleton copy, and then finished the project about two months after the end of the term. I sent the fully completed version to my University of British Columbia professor, Dr. James Phelan (name used with permission) and set it up to allow him to change and update the content quite easily – in case he wants to use it as a learning tool in his class. 

(I strongly encourage the members of the Scholarship Committee to visit my GitHub page and check it out. The URL is included at the end of this presentation with a link to the github page that is currently hosting my code for the game.")

 🎬 9/10  — Founding My IT Company: A New Model

SCRIPT:
“In 2017, I started my own IT company, Storybook Solutions. The initial reason was simple and accidental: I had several friends with small businesses who desperately needed IT support but couldn't afford it. They asked my advice and I offered to help; word of my capability and affordability for computer tech related issues spread throughout the community. My clients were small businesses, nonprofits, start-ups, and grassroots organizations—people who didn't need and couldn't afford full-time IT services but, with all the ransomware, cyberattacks, system upgrades, and technology that's part of the workforce now, they needed someone they could trust to help them navigate it. 

I became that person. From fixing computer hardware, to upgrading RAM, hard drives or SSDs, to installing programs and creating manuals, to helping them secure their systems from threats and educating them and their staff in network safety—basically, if it had to do with computer technology, my clients got in the habit of calling me.
 
I'm proud to say that none of them have suffered any serious data breaches since I've been working with them and though two were hit with ransomware, neither had to pay a dime because I simply wiped their systems clean and reinstalled them from the backups with very little lost. At my busiest I had 8 regular clients I would see weekly or bi-weekly, another 7 or so whom I saw quarterly, about 10 on a semi-annual basis and then any number of people who would call me for one off jobs like building them a computer or recovering a non-responsive unit.


 🎬 SLIDES 11/12— Theme: Impacting Diverse Communities

SCRIPT:

The organizations I served are the backbone of a healthy community. By improving their tech environments and their operational capacity, I directly impacted and supported them and the people they served.

Organizations that don't have a full time IT department often face serious limitations because of their lack of IT infrastructure and support and these limitations restrict their ability to serve their communities effectively. Ransomware attacks not only fund terrorist organizations but can result in bankruptcy, driving a service or support out of a community entirely. 

I made sure my services were accessible in every sense of the word—financially, practically, and educationally. I didn't just fix their computers; I taught them how to navigate their systems confidently so they could do basic troubleshooting themselves. Knowledge is power and my goal was to spread it, not hoard it.

Technology should not be a weapon used against us. It should be a tool that empowers us. It should not be intimidating. It should be accessible. That is the impact I had. One of my clients, owners of Okanagan Pro Painting and parents of a special needs child received a ransomware demand of $750,000. The owner’s wife called me incredibly distraught as this would have bankrupted them. I told her not to worry and not to pay as data losses would be minimal since everything had been cloned a week ago. She burst in to tears and called me an Angel and I swear I felt like a superhero. I spent the next day walking them through how to wipe, reinstall and then clone their systems. 

 🎬 SLIDES 13/14 — Making IT Affordable: Innovation Through Recycling

SCRIPT:
Another impact I am quite proud of is how I made my services more affordable while also protecting the environment. I didn't just lower my rates—I fundamentally rethought how IT support could work. 

One of my clients owned a pawn shop and I would sometimes help him unlock tablets phones or laptops or fix them if that was financially viable. If it wasn’t financially viable sometimes I would accept the broken equipment in lieu of partial payment because from it I was able to harvest hard drives, ram, network cards, graphics cards, and various other components that I could then use to upgrade or repair the components of systems belonging to my other clients and only charge them for the labor, not the parts. I was also able to broker deals between larger more tech reliant companies when they did upgrades – some of my smaller clients were happy to purchase those units and I just the brokered the transaction

I re-purposed tens of thousands of dollars in parts and equipment this way and passed those savings on as well as keeping all those parts out of the landfills for a little longer and extending their viable lives. Unfortunately, this method of impact is no longer as viable due to companies now insisting on not having upgradable parts in their computers.


SLIDES 15/16 — Leadership as a Woman in IT

SCRIPT:
Another community that I believe that I’ve had an impact on is women in the IT sector. Being one of a very limited number of women in the IT industry means I'm not just building my own career—I'm setting a standard. I'm creating a path. And I'm proving what women in this field are capable of.

Regardless of my knowledge, skill or work ethic my career has been a challenge because none of those are the first things someone notices about me. I have been constantly underestimated and undervalued in an industry that is quite famously and notoriously male-dominated and sexist.  Male peers would often sneer indulgently and test my knowledge condescendingly.

I've also needed to be very conscious of my appearance in a way that male colleagues never had to be, having to project not only professionalism but also success. I've had to stand up to institutionalized sexism, presumptions, and prejudice, and do so in a way that was still feminine, gentle, and didn't harm my reputation or turn my peers against me. I needed good word-of-mouth advertising. I needed referrals. I needed to be taken seriously. 

For those of us who are coming first in this industry, it is essential that we serve as an example of the very best that is possible, that we understand the importance of being a role model and hold ourselves to the standards that demands. We are setting the bar.

 🎬 SLIDES 17/18 — Why I'm Pursuing My MLIS at SJSU

SCRIPT:
One thing I have not addressed in this application to date is why I am pursuing my masters in Library Science and why through SJSU. 

For years I wanted to be a librarian. Since I first learned to read at 3 I have loved books. Books have been my solace, my distraction, my comfort and my friends. I have lived a thousand lives on a hundred different worlds. I have experienced every age of history,  I have fallen in love with a hundred heroes and suffered the abuse of a thousand villains. I have learned two languages and countless practical skills. There is nothing in any world that a book cannot give you if you let it. 

Then I fell into the IT world, mostly by accident.—It was never really my plan. I never intended to be a pioneer or a crusader; I just saw a need that I could do something about, one that really challenged my original life goal. I really believed in what I was doing and the impact I was having on my communities. 

But COVID impacted me and so I started looking at my original goal again. 
This led me to SJSU and I was taken totally by surprise. In exploring SJSU’s School of Information Technology and MLIS program I found a program that was a unique combination that almost seems to have been tailor made for me. 

Through this program, I’ll be able to extend the reach of the work I’m already doing in my communities and deepen its long-term impact while at the same time being able to achieve my lifelong goal of being a librarian.

 🎬 SLIDES 19/20 — Future Vision

SCRIPT: 
To be honest, I don't know exactly where I'm going to end up after this program. I’d like to think it will be in a library but the truth is, despite falling into it by accident I have found a deep sense of purpose in my desire to help others navigate rapidly changing technology and helping to keep them safe from rapidly expanding threats. 
Librarians have always seemed like the guardians of  the world's knowledge. I want to help expand, contribute to, and make that knowledge as accessible as possible to everybody regardless of income or education. I want to keep being worthy of the labels of pioneer and role model. I want to never forget the honor and responsibility that comes with those terms. I hope I find somewhere that I can achieve both but I don’t want to close any doors on either right now. Those are the impacts I have made and want to continue making and those are the communities I want to keep impacting. I want the MLIS faculty of SJSU to follow my career with pride and say "See her? Yeah, she is one of ours. We did that".

 🎬 SLIDES 21/22   — Impact Summary

SCRIPT:
"When you think about my application, I hope you remember four things:

I am a Creator. I create apps, board games, web tools, interfaces, opportunities, solutions, literature, and help for anybody I can. 

I am a Leader/Role Model. I began and ran my own IT company from the ground up as a young female in a male-dominated industry. I supported my community and the businesses within it—regardless of budget. I pioneered a new model for affordable and empowering IT services. I opened doors and tore down walls for all the women who come after me. 

I am an Advocate. I'm an advocate for the importance of small businesses. For sustainability and environmental contentiousness over consumerism.  I’m an advocate for accessible and empowering technology. I'm an advocate for good cybersecurity practices that serve to protect all of us. And I'm an advocate and example of what women in tech can accomplish and just how far we can go.

But more than anything else I am a librarian. I am a custodian and defender of knowledge. And I will make you proud of me.
